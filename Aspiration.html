					<h4> ------ Career ----- </h4>
					<p> To have a successful career in the near future is one of my aspiration in life.
					Like having a stable job.</p>
				
					<h4> ------ Academic ----- </h4>
					<p> To graduate or accomplish my studies is one of my goal to prove to my parents
					that i didn't waste the money that they give to me and all the hard word that they encounter
					through raising me and expenses they give to me. </p>
				
					<h4> ------ Personal ----- </h4>
					<p> To be able to travel around the world, visiting other places, and learning another lauguage is
					one of my personal goal if i got a stable job.</p>
				
					<h4> ------ Relations ----- </h4>
					<p> To have a boyfriend, getting married at the age of 25 or 28 and to have my own family.
					To have a partner that i can lean on if i have problems and stress in my job. To have a partner
					who will accept me as who and what i am. It is an aspiration but i hope i meet a man who will
					jam with me throughout my craziness and naughtiness. </p>
				
					<h4> ------ Financial ----- </h4>
					<p> Not to be ambitious but to have a secure financial to built my own business is the most important thing.
					The business that i want to built most be unique that will catch to the eye to my fellow millinials. Once 
					i have a successfull business i can have a stable career as a business woman, to do the personal goal 
					and to find a partner in crime.</p>
